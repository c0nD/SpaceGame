This project is a 2D action-RPG. It is still very much so a work in progress, but many core gameplay mechanics are already implemented.

I hope to have a working gameplay loop by the end of 2022. I am still a student, so finding time to work on it is sparce! Once this loop is finished,
I'll go back through and add documentation to the code to help better navigate through if you'd like to spin it into your own game / mod it.
